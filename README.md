PURPOSE

Nobody wants their mood ruined by seeing news they didn't want to see. The purpose of nunu is to tailor news segments to the emotion of the user. The goal is to help users see the information they truly want to see and filter news stories simply, weeding out unintended, uninteresting stories. 

CURRENT

As of now, nunu has a splash screen that leads to a home screen with seven different colored buttons representing various emotions. Each of these buttons can be clicked on, but the first button/emotion ("Happy") is what's being focused on at the moment. On all current pages there is the option in the top left corner to return back to the previous screen. A news-fetching API key has been secured through NewsAPI, but implementation is still being worked through. 

FUTURE

In the future, each button will lead to a page filled with news stories that can be scrolled through and selected to see in a larger view. Aforementioned news stories will be tailored specifically to the emotion selected as defined in the purpose of the application itself. There are also plans to improve the user experience by adding the option to create an account that can be signed into later on. This would allow users to save news stories they find interesting and even build an algorithm within the different emotion selections to better suit the user. Finally, the application design will also be modified. The intention is to have a sleek, modern design that doesn't sacrifice usability.
