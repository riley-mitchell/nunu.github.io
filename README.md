# nunu.github.io
PURPOSE

Nobody wants their mood ruined by seeing news they didn't want to see. The purpose of nunu is to tailor news segments to the emotion of the user. The goal is to help users see the information they truly want to see and filter news stories simply, weeding out unintended, uninteresting stories. 

UPDATE

The splash, login, and home screens are all complete visually. The login screen still needs to be worked on further to have individual account logins (not just USER and PASSWORD). To expand on individual accounts, there are planned additions for the future with having custom logins, feedback on stories, and an AI-backed news feed, not just emotion. In-app storage (user information), feedback loops (news feedback), and content collaborative filtering (AI news feed) with Surprise (Python library) will be used to do this. Data will be collected anonymously to protect users’ privacy. Additionally, information will be encrypted in transit and at rest for added privacy protection. The individual views and news fetching is complete as well, visually and in terms of implementation. Sentiment analysis needs to be improved which I plan to do through an entirely new application, called Hugging Face Transformers. This is a state-of-the-art python machine learning model that will be far better than keywords. I will use this model to redo the “Happy” and “Sad” buttons and for the remaining five moods. Lazy loading and caching will be used in the future to optimize app performance. After making these additions and adjustments, nunu will be complete.
